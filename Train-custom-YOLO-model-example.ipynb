with 4 annotated species (e.g. 'cowtail_sting_ray','pink_stingray','blacktip_reef_shark','whitetip_reef_shark) but only want to train a simple model with two classes such as 'shark' and 'ray', then you can rename your classes to reduce the number of labels. In this case, depending on the class number that was assigned to your species on your annotations dataset (e.g. 0 is 'cowtail_sting_ray', 1 is 'pink_stingray',2 is 'blacktip_reef_shark',3 is 'whitetip_reef_shark), then you can remap as in the example below.\n","\n","- **`collapse_map`**  \n","  Maps **original class IDs** → **new group names**.  \n","  - Only IDs listed here are **kept**.  \n","  - Commented-out lines are **ignored** (those classes will be dropped).  \n","\n","\n","- **`allowed_ids`**  \n","  Set of original IDs you’re keeping (i.e., the keys of `collapse_map`).
